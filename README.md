#Very many hath been the testimonies of truth and large hath been the declarations that hath been given forth by the servants of the Lord, both sons and daughters of the followers of the Lamb amongst whom I having heard, beleived, and received their report, and the Lord having opened the eye within the vail, that made manifest his living witness, that witnessed to the truth cannot but give in my testimony to those pretious truths that hath been declared by them, though many for the witnessing thereof hath gone through many hardships, great suffering, & long imprisonments ... I say I cannot but give my testimony, and chiefly concerning tythes as the Lord hath brought it to me, that for which hath been the cause of so much persecution in all ages, with something concerning oaths, which so many snares, traps and gins, hath been laid for the righteous innocent servants of the Lord, because they cannot swear. And these are the testimonies given forth from one that loves and fears the Lord, M.W.#
